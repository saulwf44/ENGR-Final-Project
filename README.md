# ENGR-Final-Project
'''
*** I made this project private so only people coming from my LinkedIn or with a link can view it, this is only to demostrate my coding abilities and not to share answers to my final exam ***

This project was a final exam for my Engineering class. I recieved an almost perfect score.
This program works with hot_laps.csv, therefore when prompted to give the name of the file type: "hot_laps.csv".
Once the program reads the .csv file, the program will ask for a list of distances for which you will want the velocity information. 
The maximum distance is 2.228719 miles, so any value between 0 t0 2.228719 will be accepted. 
The rest of the information about the final project can be viewed in the Project Details pdf.
